    <div id="wheatCrops" class="content">
        <p>The objective of this study was to research academic and literature work related to studying the behavior of VV and VH and classification of Wheat crop areas by using SAR data. However, the general objective of the study was to assess and map the wheat crop in the district of Thatta, Sindh. The results showed that cross-polarization (VH) backscattering is useful to monitor the crop as it showed variable trends at different stages of plant growth throughout the growing season. The relation of NDVI with the VV and VH backscatter showed similar variability when wheat crops reached their maturity.</p>

    <li onclick="toggleContent('speckleDivergence')">»Speckle divergence for the identification of built-up areas</li>
    <div id="speckleDivergence" class="content">
        <p>The objective of this project was to assess speckle divergence for the identification of built-up areas based on one single-polarized SAR image and to compare SAR data with optical data. Speckle divergence helps to enhance the built-up areas. It showed appropriate results for feature extraction of built-up areas at a certain level, but by increasing the threshold, it also included those areas which were not part of the built-up.</p>

    <li onclick="toggleContent('temporalAnalysis')">»Temporal analysis among NDVI, SAVI, MSAVI, and IDW</li>
    <div id="temporalAnalysis" class="content">
        <p>The objective of this project was to find the temporal change of vegetation condition in Tharparkar and to compare different techniques such as NDVI, SAVI, and MSAVI to analyze vegetation along with the precipitation rate of Sindh and its impact in 2009. The results showed that MSAVI produced enhanced results for identifying vegetation among other used techniques. In 2014, vegetation increased as compared to 2009. Its main cause could be drought effects observed between mid-2009 - mid-2010 and the below-average precipitation rate, which favored the temporal change analysis.</p>

    <li onclick="toggleContent('SSEBI')">»S-SEBI: A Simple Remote Sensing Algorithm to Estimate the Surface Energy Balance</li>
    <div id="SSEBI" class="content">
        <p>The objectives of this project were to estimate the surface energy balance by using Simplified Surface Energy Balance Index (S-SEBI) and evapotranspiration using remote sensing data, as well as to understand different processes in surface energy balance and familiarize with S-SEBI. The results shown for S-SEBI are: no additional ground-based measurement is needed to derive evaporative fraction if surface extremes are present. The extreme temperatures in the S-SEBI for wet and dry conditions vary with changing albedo values, whereas other methods like SEBAL try to determine a fixed temperature for wet and dry conditions. It worked appropriately for high-resolution images like LANDSAT-TM.</p>

    <li onclick="toggleContent('landsatSoil')">»Evaluation of Landsat Multispectral Data for Automated Mapping of Surface Soil Texture</li>
    <div id="landsatSoil" class="content">
        <p>The aim of this project was to evaluate Landsat Multispectral Data for Automated Mapping of Surface Soil Texture. The result showed that fine-scale spatial variability analysis and modeling of surface soil properties of a large area were possible using satellite remote sensing data, as most of these soil properties (e.g., soil texture) directly or indirectly influence soil reflectance. The spectral reflectance data can be an alternative to traditional methods for determining soil attributes, and a Multivariate Linear Regression approach had been adopted for studying the relationship between surface soil properties and soil reflectance. Band 2, 4, 5, and 6 were found to be the best predictors of percent silt and clay.</p>

        <p>The aim of this thesis was to analyze the performance of fiber at different parameters. A high-capacity trunk transmission/reception system based on optical fiber WDM and video/audio/data transmission/reception systems was established, as it is used in the telecom industry. The transmission was subjected to various unfavorable conditions, and optical losses were measured. A thorough analysis of losses due to various conditions was performed, and characterization of losses was done. Considering all, remedial measures were proposed, and their results were shown in the form of reduced optical losses and reduced transmission errors.</p>
